### What I learned

HTML

- Adding SVG's via <img src="path-to-svg"> instead of copy+pasting what's inside of svg and cluttering index.html for no reason

CSS

- Want a border-radius of a circle? Use border-radius: 50%
- Want to add an effect when user clicks on an element? Use element:focus
- Want to have a better looking hover effects? Use transition: 0.3s;

JS

- I can't addEventListener to an array, so I have to run a for loop
- In a loop, to every array item addEventListener (and an anonymous function that'll run when event gets triggered)
